            <h1>What is HTML?</h1>
            <p>
                HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.

                With HTML you can create your own Website.

                HTML is easy to learn - You will enjoy it!
            </p>
            <p>
                
                HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                HTML consists of a series of elements
                HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on
                HTML elements are represented by tags
                Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page
            </p>
            <h1>Beginner's tutorials</h1>
            <p>Our HTML Learning Area features multiple modules 
                that teach HTML from the ground up — no previous knowledge
                 required
            </p>
                <h4 class="text-h4">Introduction to HTML</h4>
            <p>This module sets the stage, getting you used to important 
                concepts and syntax such as looking at applying HTML to text,
                 how to create hyperlinks,
               and how to use HTML to structure a web page.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-h4">Multimedia and embedding</h4>
            <p>This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia 
                in your web pages, including the different ways that images 
                can be included, 
                and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-h4">HTML tables</h4>
            <p>Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable,
                 accessible way can be a challenge. This module covers basic table markup,
                  along with more complex features such as implementing captions 
                  and summaries.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-h4">HTML forms</h4>
            <p>Forms are a very important part of the Web — 
                these provide much of the functionality you need 
                for interacting with websites, e.g. registering and logging in, 
                sending feedback, buying products, and more. 
                This module gets you started 
                with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.

                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building 
                block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of
                 web content.
                 Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to
                  describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) 
                  or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). <br>
                 <br>
                "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, 
                either within a single website or between websites. 
                Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. 
                By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created
                 by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
                HTML Elements
                An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and an end tag, 
                with the content inserted in between: 
        
            </p>
            <h1>References </h1> 
            <h4 class="text-h4">HTML reference</h4>
            <p>HTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified 
                by some number of attributes.
                 HTML documents are connected to each other with links.
            </p>
                <h4 class="text-h4">HTML element reference</h4>
            <p>Browse a list of all HTML elements.</p>
            <h4 class="text-h4">HTML attribute reference</h4>
            <p>Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that
                 configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-h4">Global attributes</h4>
            <p>Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements,
                 even those not specified in the standard.
                  This means that any non-standard elements must still permit 
                  these attributes,
                 even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-h4">Link types</h4>
            <p>In HTML, various link types can be used to 
                establish and define the relationship between 
                two documents. Link elements that types can be set on include
